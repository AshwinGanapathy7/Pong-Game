# Pong Game

## Description:
This is a simple pong game that I made using pygame. I built it while learning the module and it is a simple game that I was able to get up and running quickly. It taught me basic concepts such as collision detection, moving objects on the screen and keyboard input. I also learned how to make an end screen. Overall, I learned many game dev skills and built a game that is extremely fun to play with a friend.
